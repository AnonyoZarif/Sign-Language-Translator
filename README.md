# Sign-Language-Translator
**Work in Progress** (The code will get the comments in the upcoming days)

Neural Network created using Sequential architecture and combination of LSTM and Dense layers in order to translate American Sign Language (ASL) into text.

## Description

This project provides an opportunity for people to train their own Neural Network by recording their own dataset of ASL signs in an intuitive and simple manner.
The whole project can be split into three different parts:
1. Data collection;
2. Model training;
3. Real time predictions.
